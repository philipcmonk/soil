principles:
- 2D ascii-compatible map.  we want to have a map/exploration character
  to this game
- time is used as the basic limiter.  clients can cheat, but they can't
  cheat the time of the server
- no ticks, only continuous time.  when a command comes in, we check to
  see what has happened since the last command

- perhaps every time a command comes in, we go ahead and refresh
  everything
- should tick allow locomotion?  ie input and output of spot.  maybe so,
  but not yet

ideas:
- an item which rewards you for precisely hitting it at a certain moment
  (subsecond precision for a frustrating mini-game)

first step:
- a 2d map that you can walk around, pick up wood, and put it in the
  fire
